GPIO:
- Make sdcard take Output for SSEL
- Make fat take Output for activity light

Add SD card detect

Fix stack back traces

Let Ethernet specify MTU - get rid of random constants

Add Route::_pmtu

Make FAT16 use half the space of FAT32 for cluster list

Implement CRC7

Implement TCP

Run system clock fully off Timer1
- Don't stop or reset TC, just interrupt on match
- In handler, add TC to system clock and reload with new value
- Increase default timer to 8 seconds

Improve exeption handler - traceback all threads, print thread state
- Write tool to symbolize console crash output

Thread features
- Priority willing
- Thread structure should be in internal mem (maybe at the top of the
  thread's stack) - for single-cycle access
- Track max stack usage

Containers should have a _resize flag to enable/disable auto resizing.

Inline-asm Ntohs/Ntohl, etc;
- ReadBE32(), ReadBE16(), StoreBE16(), StoreBE32(),
- ReadLE32(), ReadLE16(), StoreLE16(), StoreLE32(),
- ReadSwap32(), ReadSwap16(), StoreSwap16(), StoreSwap32(),

Optimize IP checksumming

Implement Watchdog
- Use hw watchdog

Assign an internal flash sector for non-volatile params, like the
ethernet Mac address.  See if we can set aside a small internet
flash sector in link.cmd.
