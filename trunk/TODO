Check if BUSY_WAIT is needed with Flyswatter

Add PINSEL macros to create bit fields

Move Output from arm/lpc_gpio.h to someplace generic.

Run system clock fully off Timer1
- Don't stop or reset TC, just interrupt on match
- In handler, add TC to system clock and reload with new value
- Increase default timer to 8 seconds

Make feature set more configurable
  + I2C normal (100kHz)/fast mode (400kHz)
  + *ALL* networking support on/off
  + TCP on/off
  + SD card support on/off
  + FAT write support on/off

Better instrumentation control
- NDMSG to suppress debug messages
- Break out assert into BoundsCheck(), Invariant(), Precondition(), PointerCheck()
- Add StackCheck()

Port to STR711
- Embest STR711 board
- Memory layout

Add Toshiba LCD driver
- To hardware/

Add configure option for LpcGpio to use Fast GPIO

Port to LPC2468
- Ethernet
- Memory layout
- Olimex LPC-E2468

Add LCD panel text driver
- Add graphics support
- Custom text?

Implement TCP

Add Route::_pmtu, TCP PMTU

Optimize IP checksumming

Add SD card detect

Improve exeption handler - traceback all threads, print thread state
- Write tool to symbolize console crash output

Thread features
- Priority willing
- Thread structure should be in internal mem (maybe at the top of the
  thread's stack) - for single-cycle access
- Track max stack usage

Implement CRC
- SD CRC7
- Get fast crc16 to work!!!

Inline-asm Ntohs/Ntohl, etc;
- ReadBE32(), ReadBE16(), StoreBE16(), StoreBE32(),
- ReadLE32(), ReadLE16(), StoreLE16(), StoreLE32(),

Improve SPI ReadBuffer
- a 512 transfer currently takes ~7msec, of which > 5msec is crc16!!!
- use READ_MULTIPLE for cluster?  Still, the READ_BLOCK itself is only 3-10%.

Implement Watchdog
- Use hw watchdog

Add support for writing flash

Assign an internal flash sector for non-volatile params, like the
ethernet Mac address.  See if we can set aside a small internet
flash sector in link.cmd.
- On LPC2468 there is nvram - use that instead
- Provide abstraction to hide implementation and to provide a locking
  interface and CRC-32.

Permit disabling of Fat LFN so directories can be loaded and searched
one sector at a time, for highly memory constrained boards.
