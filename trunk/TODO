Add I2C support
- Bus, device
- LIS302DL use case

Add Toshiba LCD driver

Abstraction
- Move CS8900A into cs8900a.{h,cpp}, typedef driver to Ethernet
- Use similar scheme for SerialPort: LpcSerialPort and typedef, lpcserial.{h,cpp}
- Repeat for Timer: LpcTimer, lpctimer.{h,cpp}
- Repeat for SPI, I2C
- Move LPC files into lpc/ dir
- Add board dir olimex-lpc-l2294/
- Make feature set more configurable
  + I2C normal (100kHz)/fast mode (400kHz)
  + *ALL* networking support on/off
  + TCP on/off
  + SD card support on/off
  + FAT write support on/off
  + #define _console _uart0

Better instrumentation control
- NDMSG to suppress debug messages
- Break out assert into BoundsCheck() and Invariant().
- Add StackCheck()

Add LCD panel text driver
- Add graphics support
- Custom text?

Add EINT connect support
- Signal EventObject on interrupt
- Add support for timer capture-and-interrupt for precise event time capture

Implement TCP

Add Route::_pmtu, TCP PMTU

Optimize IP checksumming

Run system clock fully off Timer1
- Don't stop or reset TC, just interrupt on match
- In handler, add TC to system clock and reload with new value
- Increase default timer to 8 seconds

Add SD card detect

Improve exeption handler - traceback all threads, print thread state
- Write tool to symbolize console crash output

Thread features
- Priority willing
- Thread structure should be in internal mem (maybe at the top of the
  thread's stack) - for single-cycle access
- Track max stack usage

Implement CRC
- SD CRC7
- Get fast crc16 to work!!!

Inline-asm Ntohs/Ntohl, etc;
- ReadBE32(), ReadBE16(), StoreBE16(), StoreBE32(),
- ReadLE32(), ReadLE16(), StoreLE16(), StoreLE32(),

Improve SPI ReadBuffer
- a 512 transfer currently takes ~7msec, of which > 5msec is crc16!!!
- use READ_MULTIPLE for cluster?  Still, the READ_BLOCK itself is only 3-10%.

Implement Watchdog
- Use hw watchdog

Assign an internal flash sector for non-volatile params, like the
ethernet Mac address.  See if we can set aside a small internet
flash sector in link.cmd.

Move arm-specific stuff into arm.cpp, arm.h

Eliminate dependency on lpc22xx.h
