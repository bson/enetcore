Implement Stm32Sdio for H753
  - Verify that AHB_FREQ is a multiple of 12.5MHz for Default Speed,
    25MHz for High Speed
  - Determine what the card supports: DS, HS, SDR50, DDR50?
  - Can H753 support SDR/DDR? (1.8V)

Stm32Sdio
  - Integrate CARD_DET using Gpio Pin and check before ops

Implement Reset (under arch/armv7m, to use CM4/CM7 core software reset)

Add MWait/MWaitFor with MWaitObject

Nvic::InstallCSWHandler() could simply call InstallSystemHandler() and
set up pendsv_handler as a fast exception handler.

Add static IP config
  - make DHCP support a compile time option

Clean up genfont.py and call it something else
