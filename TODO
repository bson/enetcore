Refactor chip support
- Move LPC in under nxp/lpc407x and nxp/lpc (common)
- Move stuff under arm into arm/cm4, cm0, cm7, etc
- Much of what's in board.h (e.g. skyblue/board.h) belongs in the application config.h
- Make more hardware support optional (e.g. SD, FAT)
- Make DHCP support a compile time option

- Move application out of enetcore tree
- Make enetcore a submodule of application

Clean up genfont.py and call it something else
