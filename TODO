Port to STM32H753

Implement StmEthernet for H753

Implement LAN8720A PHY

Replace header file #ifdef's with #pragma once

DMA peripherals should have a fixed DMA stream assigned since DMAMUX can now
assign any request to any stream.

Add DMA2 and DMAMUX2 if there is a use case.

See if it's possible to declare a __ccm macro to relocate specific functions
to CCM when available
- Section-per-function
- Static initializer to copy the sections to CCM

Make ENABLE_PANEL work again

Create startup code entirely in C.

Test HSI config

Fix SWO/Openocd

Enable the backup regulator in Power
- Set CSR.BRE, wait for CSR.BRR to get set
- Otherwise backup SRAM is lost on Vbat

Add ESP12E serial support

Remove SPI to ESP12, use UART only
- Board rev

Clock rollover: allow fractional HZ (e.g. 0.1)

Add MDMA memmove() for large blocks (IOBuffer?)?

Implement StmWdt

Implement StmSdio

Implement a "logout" feature in BKPSRAM

Implement StmI2c (TBD - no use case, need test board)

Implement StmUsbDev (TBD - no use case, need test board)

Implement StmI2s (TBD - no use case, need test board)

Implement Reset (under arch/armv7m, to use CM4/CM7 core software reset)

Add MWait/MWaitFor with MWaitObject

Nvic::InstallCSWHandler() could simply call InstallSystemHandler() and
set up pendsv_handler as a fast exception handler.

Add static IP config
  - make DHCP support a compile time option

Clean up genfont.py and call it something else
