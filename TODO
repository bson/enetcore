Make UART use Ring<> (see ring.h) instead of Deque<>.  It's much lower
overhead and less contention.  Just block threads if it's full.  Don't permit output
from an exception context in the general case.

Make more use of IPLs and less hard interrupt masking.  Ethernet already does; make other
devices do the same.  Hard interrupt masking is easier to debug (it permits single stepping
without entering interrupt handlers on timers etc), but once a device handler works use
proper IPLs to allow priority based nesting.  Maybe create some #define construct to
conditionally use hard masking for debug and testing uses.

Refactor chip support
- Move LPC in under nxp/lpc407x and nxp/lpc (common)
- Move stuff under arm into arm/cm4, cm0, cm7, etc
- Much of what's in board.h (e.g. skyblue/board.h) belongs in the application config.h
- Make more hardware support optional (e.g. SD, FAT)
- Make DHCP support a compile time option

- Move application out of enetcore tree
- Make enetcore a submodule of application

Clean up genfont.py and call it something else
